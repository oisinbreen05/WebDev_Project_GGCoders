            <p><strong>Christian von Koenigsegg</strong> and his engineers transformed spare time into innovation with the one-off Koenigsegg CCGT GT1, a prototype 
                built for endurance racing. This remarkable car, crafted in 2007, recently sold for £3.3 million at Bonhams’ Goodwood Festival of Speed auction. 
                With a 600+ bhp naturally aspirated V8, it powered a lightweight chassis under 1,000 kg and featured a carbon fiber/Kevlar body generating 600 kg of downforce. 
                Built over three years by a dedicated team led by Dag Bölenius, the CCGT was tested in 2008 by Loris Bicocchi. However, changes to GT1 class regulations—raising
                 homologation requirements from 20 to 350 cars—halted Koenigsegg’s Le Mans ambitions. Despite this, the CCGT remains a symbol of automotive excellence and innovation.</p>
